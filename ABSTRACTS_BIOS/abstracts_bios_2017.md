# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of all the talk abstracts and bios I write for events in 2017.

Hopefully I'll be able to re-use at least some of them ;)

**Title**: Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome

**Abstract**:

BACKGROUND
Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. The Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (http://nspn.org.uk) seeks to understand biological underpinnings of the adolescent risk of depression and schizophrenia.

METHODS
Multi-parametric mapping magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure cortical thickness and intracortical myelination in 297 population volunteers aged 14â€“24 years old. Regional measures at 308 locations across cortex were combined into a structural covariance network and calculated topological measures of degree and closeness centrality extracted. We related nodal measures to regional gene transcriptome data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (http://human.brain-map.org). All statistical analyses were conducted using permutation tests with significance set at P < .05 after correction for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
We found that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 years. However, association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adolescence. Adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of shrinkage/myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. All results replicated in two independent cohorts.

CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that normative human brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consolidating anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental variation of this consolidation process may be relevant both to normal cognitive and behavioral changes and the high incidence of schizophrenia during human brain adolescence.

**Title**: Intra-cortical myelination during adolescence: linking MRI networks with gene transcription profiles


**Abstract**:

We would appreciate it if you could submit an abstract (230-250 words) for publication in a supplement to the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology (ENP). Abstracts of all invited speakers will be reviewed for publication. We would like you to submit an abstract before 1 March, if you are not planning to submit an abstract or if the deadline is not feasible for you please inform us via paris2017@ecnp.eu.


**Bio**:

Dr Whitaker is a Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute (London, UK). She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia. She was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge from 2012 to 2017. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and is a passionate advocate for reproducible neuroscience. She is an Fulbright scholarship alumna and 2016/17 Mozilla Fellow for Science.
