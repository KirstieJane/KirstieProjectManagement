# Kirstie Project Management

This is the repository in which Kirstie keeps all her day to day to do lists as issues/documentation/WIPs etc.

At time of writing the project is not designed for collaboration and is not open to contributions unless specifically invited.

If you're looking for a project to contribute to please check out [STEMM Role Models](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels)!

Thanks for stopping by :wave:
